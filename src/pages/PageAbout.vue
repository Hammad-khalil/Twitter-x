      <p>
        X, commonly known by its former name Twitter, is a social media website
        based in the United States. With over 500 million users, it is one of
        the world's largest social networks. Users can share and post text
        messages, images, and videos known historically as "tweets".
      </p>

      <p>
        Twitter became X because Elon Musk, Twitter’s owner, bought the social
        network “as an accelerant for X, the everything app” and wants to evolve
        the social networking site into a super app encompassing much more than
        simple messaging and tweeting.
